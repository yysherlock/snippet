# Simple TODO tool for daily use

* Remove `task.json` and `state.list` every morning at 8:00 a.m.
  ï¼§enerate `task.json` file from terminal input or `todo.list`, then generate `state.list`.
  To achieve this, we auto run `gentask.py` everyday at 10:00 a.m. 
  You'd better manually modified your `todo.list` before 10:00 a.m. everyday.

* When you finished some tasks, you can manually change their states into `done` in `state.list` file.
  The program will auto update `task.json` file every 30 minutes according to your `state.list` file. (achieved by crontab)
  
* Every night, at 23:59, we tar the tasks into `done.list` and `backup.list` according to the state of them.
  `done.list` collects all the finished tasks up to now.
  `backup.list` collects all the unfinished tasks up to now.
  We backup these two files every week.
